I think there is something wrong with my eyes: I can’t take them off of you. 
I need to cross the street. Would you mind holding my hand? 
Are you as beautiful on the inside as you are on the outside?
I think I need a map: I keep getting lost in your eyes.
I knew love at first sight was real when I saw you.
I would fall for you even in zero gravity.
If you were a song, you would be my favorite track.
The sparkle is so bright in your eyes–the sun is jealous.
I just won hide and seek because I found you.
Your beauty makes me appreciate being able to see.
Looking at you made me forget my pickup line.
If you were a triangle, you would be an acute one.
You looked familiar, but then I remembered I had only seen you in my dreams.
I am no photographer, but I can picture you and me together.
Feel my shirt; it is made of boyfriend material.
I am going to call you Google because you are everything I am searching for.
Can I follow you? I was told to follow my dreams.
Can I be the Romeo to your Juliet?
I just checked the crystal ball, and it says you are in my future.
So what do you do besides take my breath away?
